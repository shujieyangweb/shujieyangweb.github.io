About Dr. Yang
======
Dr. Shujie Yang is currently a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the [Department of Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mechanics](https://www.me.upenn.edu/) at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/). Additionally, I am a core faculty member of the [Center for Precision Engineering for Health](https://cpe4h.seas.upenn.edu/) and a member of the [Bioengineering](https://be.seas.upenn.edu/) Graduate Group within the School of Engineering and Applied Science at Penn. 

Dr. Yang has authored/co-authored over 40 peer-reviewed articles published in renowned journals such as _Nature Materials_, _Nature Protocols_, _Nature Communications_, _Science Advances_, _Small_, and _Lab on a Chip_, among others. His articles have received more than 2,400 citations as documented by Google Scholar (h-index: 29). And his work has been featured in various popular media outlets, such as _Nature Materials, The Science Advisory Board, '2022 in science' by Wikipedia, Phys.org, and MIT Technology Review_. Dr. Yang also serves as a reviewer for several esteemed journals, including _Science Advances, Lab on a Chip, IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control, Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems, Microfluidics and Nanofluidics, and Ultrasonics_. 

Dr. Yang obtained his PhD in Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science from Duke University in 2021. Prior to joining Penn, he served as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School. Dr. Yang's research primarily focuses on Acoustics, Microfluidics, and Biomedical Devices, with a particular interest in applying novel micro/nano technologies for applications in engineering and medicine.
